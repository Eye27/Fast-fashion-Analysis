# **Fast Fashion: A Data-Driven Analysis of Its Environmental Impact** 🌍👕  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
Fast fashion makes trendy clothing accessible, but at a significant environmental cost. This project analyzes real-world fashion data to uncover trends in pricing, material composition, and sustainability claims. Using **data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling**, we investigate whether sustainability claims are genuine or just greenwashing.  

## 🚀 **Key Features**  
✅ **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, standardizing material names, and structuring data for analysis.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding trends in pricing, material use, and sustainability labeling.  
✅ **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards to highlight key insights.  
✅ **Machine Learning:** Predicting whether a product is likely to be sustainable based on pricing and material composition.  

## 📊 **Findings**  
- 💰 **Affordability Wins Over Sustainability:** Most fast fashion items are priced under $40, promoting mass consumption.  
- ♻️ **Greenwashing Alert:** Some eco-labeled products are significantly more expensive, raising doubts about their authenticity.  
- 🌱 **Sustainability in the Minority:** Less than **15%** of the dataset consists of genuinely sustainable products.  
- 🏭 **The Polyester Problem:** Polyester and cotton dominate, contributing heavily to pollution and resource depletion.  

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)  

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset includes product pricing, material composition, and sustainability labels from various fashion brands.  

## 🎯 **Conclusion**  
Fast fashion's environmental toll is undeniable. Our data-driven insights emphasize the need for better consumer awareness and industry transparency. Ethical choices and strict regulations can push the industry towards a greener future.
